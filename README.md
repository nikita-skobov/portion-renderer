# portion-renderer

This is a 2d software rendering library. It originally started as an experiment of being able to only render portions of the screen that have changed since the last render. As such, it has a useful feature that it will not render anything unless required. So at rest, it does not take any cpu usage.

This library is just a fun experiment.

Over time, I added more features and benchmarks to try to make it fast, and use as little resources as possible.
